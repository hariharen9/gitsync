# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# GitSync Configuration Example
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Copy this file to .gitsync.yaml in your repository root and customize it.
# Most settings are optional and will be auto-detected if not provided.
#

# --- Core Git Settings ---

# base_branch: The branch that all of your feature branches are based on.
# This is the branch that will be updated from the upstream remote.
# Default: Auto-detects the default branch of your 'upstream' or 'origin' remote (e.g., 'main', 'master', 'develop').
base_branch: main

# upstream_remote: The name of the remote repository that represents the "source of truth"
# for the base_branch. This is typically the main project repository.
# Default: Auto-detects a remote named 'upstream'. If not found, it falls back to 'origin'.
upstream_remote: upstream

# origin_remote: The name of your personal fork of the repository.
# GitSync will push your updated branches to this remote.
# Default: "origin"
origin_remote: origin


# --- Branch Filtering ---

# exclude_patterns: A list of glob patterns for branches you want to hide from the list.
# This is useful for ignoring long-lived branches, release branches, or archived work.
# The patterns are matched against the full branch name.
exclude_patterns:
  # Ignore branches from other team members if you have them fetched locally
  - "*/dependabot/*"
  - "jane/*"
  - "john/feature-*"

  # Ignore release, hotfix, or version branches
  - "release/*"
  - "hotfix/*"
  - "v[0-9].*"

  # Ignore archived or old branches
  - "archive/*"
  - "old/*"
  - "backup-*"


# --- UI & Workflow Customization (Future Ideas) ---
# The settings below are examples of what could be added in the future.
# They are not currently implemented.

# manual_mode: If true, gitsync will always ask for confirmation before running
# any git commands that modify your branches.
# Default: false
# manual_mode: false

# fetch_on_start: If true, gitsync will perform a 'git fetch' from the upstream
# remote every time it starts up to ensure branch statuses are current.
# Default: true
# fetch_on_start: true

# show_command_log: If true, the "Commands that will be ran:" box will be displayed
# during update and delete operations.
# Default: true
# show_command_log: true

# log_format: A string that specifies the format for the 'git log' command
# in the log viewer pane.
# Default: "--graph --pretty=format:'%C(yellow)%h%C(reset) - %s %C(green)(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%C(reset)'"
# log_format: "--oneline"
